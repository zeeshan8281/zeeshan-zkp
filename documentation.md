# Medical Records System Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The Medical Records System is a web-based application designed to securely manage and verify medical records using zero-knowledge proofs. It provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers to submit, update, and verify medical records while maintaining data integrity and privacy.

## 2. Product Goal
The primary goal of this system is to create a secure and efficient platform for managing medical records that leverages cryptographic proofs to ensure data authenticity without revealing sensitive information. It aims to streamline medical record management while providing verifiable proof of record integrity.

## 3. Demography (Users, Location)
**Users:**  
- Healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, doctors)  
- Medical staff (nurses, administrators)  
- Patients (indirect users through their healthcare providers)  

**Location:**  
Primarily designed for use in healthcare facilities across urban and rural areas, with a focus on regions where medical record management needs modernization and enhanced security.

## 4. Business Processes
1. **Record Creation:** Healthcare providers submit basic patient information
2. **Record Update:** Medical staff updates records with treatment details
3. **Record Verification:** System generates cryptographic proofs for record verification
4. **Proof Validation:** Authorized parties can verify record authenticity
5. **Data Management:** Secure storage and retrieval of medical records

## 5. Features

### 5.1 Feature #1: Record Submission
**1. Description**  
Allows healthcare providers to submit basic patient information including age, department, and admission date. Creates a unique record ID and initializes the medical record.

**2. User Story**  
As a healthcare provider, I want to submit basic patient information so that I can create a new medical record for treatment tracking.

### 5.2 Feature #2: Record Update
**1. Description**  
Enables medical staff to update records with treatment details including condition severity, discharge date, doctor ID, and treatment code. Generates cryptographic proofs for the updated record.

**2. User Story**  
As a medical staff member, I want to update treatment details so that the patient's medical record remains current and complete.

### 5.3 Feature #3: Record Verification
**1. Description**  
Provides functionality to verify the authenticity of medical records using cryptographic proofs. Returns verification results in a standardized format.

**2. User Story**  
As an authorized party, I want to verify medical records so that I can confirm their authenticity without accessing sensitive information.

## 6. Authorization Matrix
| Role               | Create Record | Update Record | Verify Record |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Healthcare Provider | ✓             |               |              |
| Medical Staff        |               | ✓             |              |
| Authorized Verifier |               |               | ✓            |
